/**
 * PROVISIONAL LOCAL MIRROR OF `@nerima-games/mc-kernel`.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This module is scheduled for deletion. Do not build on it.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * plan.md §6 Step 3 publishes the repositories bottom-up: a repository is
 * published to GitHub Packages only once its interface has held still, and only
 * then may its consumers pin it. Nothing is published yet, so mc-sim cannot
 * `import ... from '@nerima-games/mc-kernel'` — there is no package to resolve,
 * and `scripts/check-dependency-whitelist.ts` would in any case reject an
 * import of something absent from `package.json#dependencies`.
 *
 * Rather than invent a different vocabulary that would have to be reconciled
 * later, this file mirrors the handful of kernel declarations mc-sim actually
 * uses, verbatim in shape and semantics, from
 * `mc-kernel/domain/{quantities,coordinates,clock,camera,identifiers}.ts`.
 *
 * WHEN mc-kernel IS PUBLISHED:
 *   1. add `@nerima-games/mc-kernel` to `package.json#dependencies`;
 *   2. delete this file;
 *   3. repoint every `from './kernel-vocabulary'` at `'@nerima-games/mc-kernel'`.
 * Nothing else should need to change. If step 3 turns out not to typecheck,
 * this file has drifted and the drift is the bug.
 *
 * The mirror is deliberately MINIMAL — only what mc-sim uses. A larger mirror
 * would be a larger thing to keep honest.
