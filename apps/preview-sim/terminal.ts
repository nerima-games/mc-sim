/**
 * The only impure module in the preview.
 *
 * A dev application, not shipped API.
 *
 * Everything else here — the scenario script, the panels, the probes, the
 * option parser — is a pure function of its arguments, or an `Effect` over the
 * repository's own services. Node's stdio lives behind this file so that the
 * boundary is visible rather than sprinkled, which is the same reason the
 * library keeps its clock behind a Port.
 *
 * Note what is NOT here, and what is not anywhere in this app: a clock read.
 * `Date.now()` / `new Date()` / `performance.now()` do not appear. The preview's
 * whole subject is that time is supplied rather than observed, so an app that peeked
 * at the wall clock to draw itself would be arguing against its own thesis.
 * Frames are drawn in response to keystrokes.
